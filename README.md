# Tech Used: HTML, CSS, EJS, Express 
This project took HTML, CSS, EJS, and express to get the desired result. 
# Lessons Learned
This was one of my first exposures to developing on the back end. Alot of valuable debugging came from this
and showed me how to interact with DOM through the server. Working with the thumbs up taught me about
working how events fire between the backend and the DOM. That these events are being tweaked after the 
event are takes place in the backend we are just working on what happens on the front end after that
event.
